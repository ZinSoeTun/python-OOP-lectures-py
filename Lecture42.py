# Nested class = A class defined within another class
#                            class Outer:
#                                class Inner:

# Benefits: Allows you to logically group classes that are closely related
#                 Encapsulates private details that aren't relevant outside of the outer class
#                 Keeps the namespace clean; reduces the possibility of naming conflicts
