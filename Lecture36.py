# Abstract class: A class that cannot be instantiated on its own; Meant to be subclassed.
#                 They can contain abstract methods, which are declared but have no implementation.
#                 Abstract classes benefits:
#                 1. Prevents instantiation of the class itself
#                 2. Requires children to use inherited abstract methods
